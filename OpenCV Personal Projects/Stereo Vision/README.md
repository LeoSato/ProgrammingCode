#Stereo Vision

This is a personal project to understand and implement a disparity map from stereo vision using OpenCV.

The images used in this project were obtained from the MPI Sintel Stereo Training Data. Link: http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/stereo

The left.png and right.png are the original images. The left_right_original.jpg shows the original images side by side (left image on left and right image on right).
The raw_fThe raw_filtered_disparities(BM).jpg shows the raw disparity map on the left and the filtered disparity map on the right using OpenCV StereoBM.
The raw_filtered_disparities(SGBM).jpg shows the raw disparity map on the left and the filtered disparity map on the right using OpenCV StereoSGBM.
