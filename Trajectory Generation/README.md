# Trajectory Generation

This is a personal project to use optimization packages in Python to generate a trajectory. Pyomo is used as optimization modeling language to generate the trajectories.

## Trajectory for a Particle
This project generates a trajectory for a particle with horizontal and vertical inputs. The particle is subject to gravity and drag. In this project, a trajectory was generated for minimum control input over a specified amount of time (with and without an obstacle) and minimum time.

## Trajectory for the Acrobot
This is still a work in progress. The purpose of this project is to implement trajectory optimization so the acrobot is able to reach the desired state. For example, the trajectory optimization will be able to accomplish the inverted double pendulum.
