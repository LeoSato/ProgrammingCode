# Trajectory Generation

This is a personal project to use optimization packages in Python to generate a trajectory. Pyomo is used as optimization modeling language to generate the trajectories.

## Trajectory for a Particle
This project generates a trajectory for a particle with horizontal and vertical inputs. The particle is subject to gravity and drag. In this project, a trajectory was generated for minimum control input over a specified amount of time (with and without an obstacle) and minimum time.
