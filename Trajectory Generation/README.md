#Trajectory Generation

This is a personal project to use optimization packages in Python to generate a trajectory. Pyomo is used as optimization modeling language to generate the trajectories.

##Trajectory for a particle
This project generates a trajectory for a particle with horizontal and vertical inputs. It is still a work in progress. I plan on having obstacles that the particle needs to navigate through.
