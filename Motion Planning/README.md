# Motion Planning

This folder contains my personal programming code for implementing motion planning algorithms to get a better understanding.

## PRM
The code is still a work in progress. I have implemented the roadmap and the final path that connects the nodes from the start to the goal for the PRM. I still need to create a smooth path and to add collision detection to prevent a generated path from colliding with an obstacle.

## RRT
The code is still a work in progress. Currently, I implemented the plot of the RRT but I still need to implement generating the final path that connects the start point to the end point. I also need to add collision detection to prevent a generated path from colliding with an obstacle.
