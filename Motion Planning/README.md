# Motion Planning

This folder contains my personal programming code for implementing motion planning algorithms to get a better understanding.

## A*
I have implemented the A* graph search to find a path from a start node to goal node in an obstacle with obstacles.

## PRM
The code is still a work in progress. I have implemented the roadmap, the final path that connects the nodes from the start to the goal for the PRM, and collision detection in 2D. I still need to create a smooth path, implement the PRM in higher dimensions, and implement other PRM algorithms. I also might implement constraints on the path in the future.

## RRT
The code is still a work in progress. Currently, I implemented the plot of the RRT, the final path that connects the nodes from the start to the goal for the RRT, and collision detection in 2D. I still need to create a smooth path, implement the RRT in higher dimensions, and implement other RRT algorithms. I also might implement constraints on the path in the future.
