# Motion Planning

This folder contains my personal programming code for implementing motion planning algorithms to get a better understanding.

## RRT
The code is still a work in progress. Currently, I implemented the plot of the RRT but I still need to implement generating the final path that connects the initial coordinate to the final coordinate. I also need to prevent points from generating within obstacles and an edge generating between two points to be within an obstacle.
