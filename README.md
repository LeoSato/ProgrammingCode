# Programming Code

These are examples of programming projects that I have worked on.

The Senior Capstone Project is a team project where the team designed a prototype based on the engineering design process. The project was to design a device to control a follower vehicle to follow a leader vehicle (like the cars in a convoy following the leading vehicle).

The Inverted Pendulum Simulations are a personal project to get a better understanding of robotics concepts. The pendulum dynamics were implemented and were controlled to swing up/balance.

The OpenCV Personal Projects are personal projects to help me understand and implement various features of OpenCV.
