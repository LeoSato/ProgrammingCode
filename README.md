# Programming Code

These are examples of programming projects that I have worked on. Many of these projects have been coded in Jupyter Notebooks because the code as well as the figures used for visualizations can be seen on Github (if the Jupyter Notebook file isn't loading on Github, go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and post the URL here to see the Jupyter Notebook file). I will be trying to add python source code for all my projects but for those who are interested in Jupyter Notebook, I recommend downloading the Anaconda Distribution, which includes Jupyter Notebook, located here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

## Senior Capstone Project
This is a team project where the team designed a prototype based on the engineering design process. The project was to design a device to control a follower vehicle to follow a leader vehicle (like the cars in a convoy following the leading vehicle).

## Inverted Pendulum Simulations
These are personal projects to get a better understanding of robotics concepts. The pendulum dynamics were implemented and were controlled to swing up/balance.

## OpenCV Projects
These are personal projects to help me understand and implement various features of OpenCV.

## Trajectory Generation Projects
These are personal projects to utilize and become accustomed to optimization packages in Python to generate trajectories.

## Path Planning Projects
These are personal projects for me to explore the various motion planning algorithms.
