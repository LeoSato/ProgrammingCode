# Programming Code

These are examples of programming projects that I have worked on.

## Senior Capstone Project
This is a team project where the team designed a prototype based on the engineering design process. The project was to design a device to control a follower vehicle to follow a leader vehicle (like the cars in a convoy following the leading vehicle).

## Inverted Pendulum Simulations
These are personal projects to get a better understanding of robotics concepts. The pendulum dynamics were implemented and were controlled to swing up/balance.

## OpenCV Projects
These are personal projects to help me understand and implement various features of OpenCV.

## Trajectory Generation Projects
These are personal projects to utilize and become accustomed to optimization packages in Python to generate trajectories.

## Motion Planning Projects
These are personal projects for me to explore the various motion planning algorithms.
